					The practice of deep cleaning is said to have its roots in the
					19th century, as people capitalized on the fresh, warm spring air
					to help eliminate dust and musty odors from their homes after the
					winter season. According to the 2023 Statista survey in the
					United States, 74 percent of respondents engage in annual spring
					cleaning. Spring symbolizes renewal and rebirth, making it a
					natural time for people to declutter, organize, and refresh their
					living spaces.
				</p>
				<p>
					Recent studies have shown that around 86% of adults in the US use
					the start of spring as motivation to clean and freshen up their
					homes. After keeping windows closed during the winter, spring
					provides an opportunity to ventilate the home and improve indoor
					air quality by dusting, vacuuming, and airing out rooms. Among
					those who spring clean, survey findings show Americans focus
					their targeted hygiene practices on the kitchen (64%), bedrooms
					(61%) and bathrooms (59%). When choosing their cleaning products,
					Americans who spring clean rank effectiveness (44%) as the most
					important, followed by multi-purpose (18%) and cost (12%). For
					those seeking professional assistance, consider hiring through
					the Tenafli App, where cost and expertise are carefully weighed
					to ensure optimal results, allowing you to simply enjoy the
					outcome. Professionals can aid in decluttering and recommend the
					most suitable products tailored to your home. Deep cleaning the
					home in spring helps remove dust, allergens, and germs that may
					have accumulated over the winter. This promotes better indoor air
					quality and reduces the risk of illness, allergies, and
					respiratory issues. Launder all bedding, including sheets,
					pillowcases, and blankets. Wash curtains, towels, and other
					linens according to their care instructions.
				</p>
				<p>
					As the weather gets warmer, Americans spend more time outdoors
					and may entertain guests. Spring cleaning ensures that the home
					is clean, organized, and inviting for social gatherings and
					outdoor activities. While deep cleaning, take the time to inspect
					your home for any repairs or maintenance tasks that may be
					needed. This could include fixing leaky faucets, replacing air
					filters, or repairing any damaged areas. After finishing your
					spring cleaning, consider setting up a recurring cleaning
					schedule to uphold the cleanliness and organization of your home
					year-round. Through Tenafli App, you can effortlessly find a
					professional cleaner tailored to your region and schedule
					preferences. Whether you opt for weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly
					services, you can select a skilled pro to handle the tasks,
					ensuring your home remains consistently tidy and welcoming
					without the need for regular personal intervention. Engaging
					professional cleaners through the Tenafli App not only ensures a
					clean house but also fosters a strong customer relationship.
					Professionals can offer valuable tips and tricks to optimize
					cleanliness and organization in your home, enhancing your overall
					experience. Moreover, by leveraging the app, you can accumulate
					rewarding points with each service booked. These points can be
					redeemed for discounts on future cleanings or even earn you a
					free cleaning session as a loyal client.
